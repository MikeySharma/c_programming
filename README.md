## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering the C programming language. Here, you will find a collection of programs ranging from basic to advanced levels, covering various concepts and algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. The examples in this repository are designed to be compiled with `gcc`, but other C compilers should work as well.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `basics/` - Contains basic C programs covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- `data_structures/` - Contains implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- `algorithms/` - Contains implementations of common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- `projects/` - Contains larger projects that demonstrate the application of C programming in real-world scenarios.
- `utilities/` - Contains utility programs and scripts that assist in development and testing.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Make (optional, for some projects)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MikeySharma/c_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run:
    ```sh
    cd c_programming/basics
    ```
3. Compile the program using `gcc`:
    ```sh
    gcc program.c -o program
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./program
    ```

For programs in the `projects` directory, refer to the README file within each project directory for specific instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional programs you'd like to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    ```
3. Make your changes and commit them:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add some feature"
    ```
4. Push to the branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```
5. Open a pull request.
